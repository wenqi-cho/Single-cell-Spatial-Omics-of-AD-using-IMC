# Single-cell-Spatial-Omics-of-AD-using-IMC
To address the limitations of existing single-cell study methods that lack a spatial context, explore spatial organisation
and cellular interactions in AD brain tissues, as well as overcome the challenges facing image
segmentation in single-cell analysis, this research project aims:
1) To assess the Steinbock method for internal use on AD post-mortem brain tissues.
2) To visualise and analyse the spatial distribution of different cell types in AD brain tissues using
IMC images, as well as to investigate the interactions between those cell types.
3) To explore the specific effects of TREM2 variants (CV, R47H, and R62H) on different cellular
components including microglia and neurons.
The research questions guiding the investigation are: “Can Steinbock be confidently used on
post-mortem AD samples to quantify single cell markers?” “What are the spatial and cellular
interactions of glial cells in relation to AD pathology, and how do the cell populations differ
between AD patients with TREM2 variants and those with common variants?”

This study holds significant implications on various fronts. While IMC has been extensively used in
cancer research, its potential in AD research remains largely untapped. This study is the first of its
kind in investigating AD’s cellular intricacies. By integrating IMC and the Steinbock framework,
this research project will set a precedent for improved image segmentation and single-cell data
quantification in AD research.
Additionally, this study forms part of the UK Dementia Research Institute (UKDRI) Multi-‘omics
Atlas Project (MAP), contributing to its goal of comprehensively characterising AD’s cellular
pathology. Focusing on microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, this study seeks to provide a spatial
validation of the findings presented by Fancy et al. from the MAP team. These findings used
IMC data generated from the different brain regions to create a comprehensive overview of AD
progression at the pathological level.
By delving into spatial and cellular interactions among glial cells, this study will shed light on
their role in disease progression, potentially uncovering novel therapeutic targets. The successful
implementation of the methodologies and insights gained from this research could inspire future
studies investigating neurological diseases beyond AD.
